Fedora uses it as default for its Workstation install and I wanted to try it for a while as the snapshotting and bitrot-detection seemed interesting for me for a while.
There seem to be some benefits to be gained from reinstalling my OS on Btrfs. This blog is meant to document my learning.
What is Btrfs, really? According to the Btrfs-Wiki:
Btrfs is a modern copy on write (CoW) filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing advanced features while also focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy administration.</description></item><item><title>FlorianUhl</title><link>https://flouhl.github.io/homepage/florianuhl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flouhl.github.io/homepage/florianuhl/</guid><description>About this Page This page is for documenting what interest me, be it computer related or anything interesting. While most of the documetation is for myself as a reference, maybe others can profit from it.
About Me I am an open source enthusiast trying to learn about all things computers, statistics, biology and music, a real nerd. While I have started many projects before making this website I never documented them publicly, so that I and others may learn more from it.</description></item><item><title>Pages</title><link>https://flouhl.github.io/homepage/pages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flouhl.github.io/homepage/pages/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
