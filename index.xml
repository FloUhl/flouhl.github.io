While most of the documetation is for my own reference, maybe others can profit from it.
About Me I am an open source enthusiast trying to learn about all things computers, statistics, biology and music, a real nerd. While I have started many projects before making this website I never documented them publicly, so that I and others may learn more from it.</description></item><item><title>My foray into Btrfs</title><link>https://flouhl.github.io/%60/posts/btrfsfirstcontact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flouhl.github.io/%60/posts/btrfsfirstcontact/</guid><description>My foray into Btrfs Why? Fedora uses it as default for its Workstation istall and I wanted to try it for a while as the snapshotting and bitrot-detection seemed interesting for me for a while.

What is Btrfs, really? According to the Btrfs-Wiki:
Btrfs is a modern copy on write (CoW) filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing advanced features while also focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy administration.</description></item></channel></rss>
