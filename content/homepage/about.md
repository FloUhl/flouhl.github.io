## About this Website
This page is for documenting what interests me, be it computer related or anything interesting.
While most of the documentation is for myself as a reference, maybe others can profit from it.

## About Me
I am an open source enthusiast trying to learn about all things computers, statistics, biology and music, a real nerd.
While I have started many projects before making this website I never documented them publicly, so that I and others may learn more from it.

I have finished studies in behavioural biology at the University of Vienna, during which I got interested in coding (R in this case).
From this tentative relationship with coding I have become enamoured with open source and statistics.
While computers have been black boxes that delivered interesting information for most of my life, I have become determined to learn more about them since finishing my masters degree.
I have in doing so discovered (desktop) Linux and enjoyed to learn more about the underpinnings and details of operating systems.
I also decided to take this aspect of my life more seriously and enrolled in a Bachelor in IT Security.
