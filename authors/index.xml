While most of the documetation is for my own reference, maybe others can profit from it.
About Me I am an open source enthusiast trying to learn about all things computers, statistics, biology and music, a real nerd. While I have started many projects before making this website I never documented them publicly, so that I and others may learn more from it.</description></item></channel></rss>
